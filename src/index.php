<strong>Game Description:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            A Tic-Tac-Toe like game in which the goal is to form primes along the rows, columns and diagonals (including secondary diagonals) in any direction. The more number of primes one makes, the better the score.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Starts with an empty N x N square.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Each player alternately fills a square with a number (except the last move is given to player 2).
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Whenever a number completes a row, column, diagonal (primary or secondary), the number of primes formed as a consequence (in any direction of the row, column or diagonal) are added to the playerâ€™s score.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            0 is not allowed to be placed in any of the border cells.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
